# HCT A2A TypeScript Sample

This sample demonstrates HCT signals in TypeScript.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the `conductor.ts` script which simulates a Performer receiving HCT signals internally (in-process simulation for simplicity, though structurally ready for A2A).
